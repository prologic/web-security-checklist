## General Tips

* Keep suggested edits/fixes/additions developer focused/friendly and short/terse. This ia a checklist not an in-depth book on security :)
* If contributing to libraries for languages, try to avoid frameworks (*if at all possible*) as these are hard to vet, audit. Contribute libraries for your favourite language that you can vet that do one thing well.
* If contributing to resources, please add respectable resources that have already been vetted by community and/or exports in the field.

Thank you :)
